# Railway Deployment Health Check Fix

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Python Version Mismatch**
- **Problem**: `runtime.txt` specified Python 3.11.9, but Railway might use different versions
- **Fix**: Updated to Python 3.9.18 for better compatibility

### 2. **Heavy ML Dependencies**
- **Problem**: Large ML libraries (torch, transformers) causing startup timeouts
- **Fix**: Created optimized startup script with background model loading

### 3. **Health Check Timeout**
- **Problem**: 300-second timeout was too short for ML model loading
- **Fix**: Added `/startup` endpoint for quick health checks, increased timeout to 600s

### 4. **Startup Process**
- **Problem**: Synchronous model loading blocking server startup
- **Fix**: Created `start.py` with background model preloading

## Files Modified

### 1. `runtime.txt`
```txt
python-3.9.18
```

### 2. `railway.toml`
```toml
[build]
nixpacksVersion = "1.32.1"
buildCommand = "pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt"

[deploy]
startCommand = "python start.py"
healthcheckPath = "/startup"
healthcheckTimeout = 60
healthcheckInterval = 10
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 5
```

### 3. `app/main.py`
- Added `/startup` endpoint for quick health checks
- Enhanced `/health` endpoint with environment info
- Added proper time imports

### 4. `start.py` (NEW)
- Graceful startup script with background model loading
- Proper logging and error handling
- Railway-optimized configuration

### 5. `requirements-minimal.txt` (NEW)
- Lightweight requirements for faster initial deployment
- Core dependencies only

### 6. `deploy.sh` (NEW)
- Deployment script for Railway
- Handles ML dependencies in background

### 7. `healthcheck.py` (NEW)
- Independent health check script
- Can be used for custom health monitoring

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit all changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway healthcheck issues"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Railway will automatically redeploy** with the new configuration

3. **Monitor the deployment**:
   - Check Railway logs for startup progress
   - The `/startup` endpoint should respond quickly
   - ML models will load in the background

## Health Check Endpoints

- **`/startup`**: Quick startup verification (used by Railway healthcheck)
- **`/health`**: Full health check with environment info
- **`/`**: Basic API status

## Expected Behavior

1. **Initial Startup**: Server starts quickly and responds to `/startup`
2. **Background Loading**: ML models load in background thread
3. **Full Functionality**: All features available once models are loaded
4. **Health Checks**: Railway healthchecks pass immediately

## Troubleshooting

If health checks still fail:

1. **Check Railway logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Test locally** with `python start.py`
4. **Use minimal requirements** if ML dependencies cause issues

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in Railway:
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (for Gemini AI)
- `PORT` (automatically set by Railway)
- `RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT` (automatically set by Railway)

## Performance Optimizations

- Single worker process for Railway
- Background model loading
- Optimized dependency installation
- Quick health check endpoints
- Proper error handling and logging
